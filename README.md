# Prometeo

Prometeo 2020 is the first edition of IIT Jodhpur's National Technical Festival. Prometeo 2020 derives its name from the Greek word for forethinker and celebrates disruptive technologies through talks, workshops, and competitions. This year's theme for Prometeo 2020 is 'Emerging Technologies for Sustainable Development' with the objective to address and discuss the possible challenges and solutions towards the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The UN identifies 17 such goals expected to be achievable by 2030. The events of this year's Prometeo revolve primarily around the goals with technology-driven solutions.
